          Using a Linux operating system for the first time quickly fed my interest in the web application genre (database and development, website design, coding etc). This led me to installing Ubuntu Server, where I was vigourously motivated to learn the ropes around LAMP  (aka LAMP Server, Linux, Apache MySQL, PHP). Having gotten a fairly advanced mail server up and running (Postfix, MySQL, Courier, SquirrelMail, Amavasis, Clam, Spamassassin etc) I found myself wanting to create more and more web applications.

          I had heard my father mentioning Ruby on Rails a few times in the past, but had brushed it off as-- just-another-neo-language trying to supersede Python, Perl, C++ or similar languages-- without really looking in-to the specifications of Ruby on Rails.  One day while browsing new Linux Distrobutions, I came across a distro named 'Turnkey Linux'.  Turnkey offers all sorts of developer's bundles, one of which being Ruby on Rails.  I admit, it looked appeasing, so I decided to actually research it for a change.  I admit, it's a beautiful language and can really produce aesthetically appeasing web-sites.  I decided to install the pre-requisites and get going with rails development.  This is my first very Ruby on Rails application, and first project of this magnitude. Although I have a 'limited' background involving coding and development, I am very pleased with this project so far and love learning ways to improve.

        This application is built on Ubuntu Linux 3.2.0-32-generic-pae kernel with Ruby version 1.9.3 - Rails version 3.2.8.  It started out as an experiment, and now is becoming quite a project. My goal for Ampersand is to become a fashionable, secure and well-accessible social platform. What does that mean? I am figuring that out as I go.

      <p>
        Having that said, my plans are eligible to change, but as of now, Ampersand offers  login/registration, user profile, shares, liked shares, follows/followers, automatic gravatar sync, private messaging, SSL (encrypted connection to ensure protected passwords and user information) while alot more is currently being developed.  Some of those developments include: public groups, instant messaging, reputation system, geo-location and photo/video uploads.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ampersand is currently being hosted on a "Heroku" server (a free online database with SSL encyption that offers developers a secure testing platform for their projects) If everything goes as planned, I hope to host Ampersand under my own domain soon.  None-the-less, I hope you like what what's in development so far!  Go ahead, give it a try.  Sign up, take a look and see for yourself!
