			<h2>A Note To Guests</h2>
		<p>
		Throughout this development process, I've been thrilled to have people actually join and test out the sites' features.  Unfortunately, alot of you have lost your account.  Is it because I hate you?  Nope!  It is due to the fact that when I add new features that require the database (such as replies and user profile information) I have to "migrate" the newly modified database from my computer over to Heroku's server, which results in a database reset. (Hence you losing your account.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Having that said, if you wish to register, that is great and I encourage it!  But just know, at <i>this</i> time I can not promise that it won't be lost.  If you are fine with that, make an account!  But for those who just want to log in to see what it's all about, I will have an account for you to use posted shortly.

			<h2>Developments</h2>
					<p>
					This is a fairly active era in regards to the development of this app.  Each major development and a brief description can be found in the updates section.  If you are keeping up with with he development process, or if you are a mere 'passer-byer' and are confused with something, chances are it is temporary and/or in development.  All major developments are documented on the Updates page as well as future plans.
