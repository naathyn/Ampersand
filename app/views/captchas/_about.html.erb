  <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: .5em;">A shorter and sweeter status</p>

    <p>
      It goes like this: You can <strong id="cp"><i>Captcha</i></strong> anything you'd
      like from quotes, favourites movies, what you did today, your current mood, 
      what the weather's like, all the way to some funny thing your cat just did ten
      seconds ago. 
    </p>

    <p>
      One <strong id="cp"><i>Captcha</i></strong> will be chosen at random and
      displayed as a comment bubble when a someone hovers over your gravatar in the
      feeds. Remember to fill them up, because everytime we see your photo in the feeds,
      we see your captchas as well!
    </p>

  <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: .5em;">Captcha' double your colour</p>

    <p>
      Just as one wants to be socially defined in person, he wishes the same for
      himself in his online community. I see it like this: When it comes to being
      social, the more interactivity a group can cook up, the more wholesome the
      environment. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice I say, <i>inter</i>activity.  While activity is valued, 
      Sometimes I feel as if we get so caught up in life's <i>activities</i>, that we
      forget to treat ourselves. 
    </p>


  <p>
    At any rate, loosen up a bit, 

      <strong><i id="cp">Captcha</strong> the moment</i>, 

    you might be surprised where it takes you.
