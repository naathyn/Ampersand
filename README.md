~ Background ~

As stated in the summary, this is my first Ruby on Rails application. While I am well capable setting up what I "do" have, I have little background with coding and development. It is only until recently I have gotten more involved with the web application genre. After installing Ubuntu Server, I quickly motivated myself to learn the ropes around LAMP. Having gotten a fairly advanced mail server up and running (Postfix, MySQL, Courier, SquirrelMail, Amavasis, Clam, Spamassassin etc) inspired me to go a little further.

I was looking for original developer's tools and, in general, something I could just go crazy with. I was going through my usual routine, browsing around Distrowatch when I happened to come across the distro, "Turnkey Linux." It was there where I read more about Ruby on Rails. At the time, I was only interested and looked at the prerequisites to start developing. After reading more about it (and becoming vaguely familiar with the terminology) I decided I would start my endeavours.

So... here I am. I am still learning, but having been only a few days, I am very pleased with what I have so far.

~ Social Rails ~

This application started out as an expiriment, and now is becoming quite a project. My goal for Social Rails is to become a fashionable, secure and well-accessible social platform. What does that mean? I am figuring that out as I go.

Having that said, my plans are elligable to change. But as of now, a user Login/Registration is accessible with the user's avatar linked to their Gravatar. All data is securely stored in a Postgresql database. The "User's Preferences" menu is now being developed.

~ Help ~

I claim ignorance! If by chance a developer "does" read this, I would love someone to collab with. In addition, any help is more than welcome.
