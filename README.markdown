>There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar trying to make up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening. The Korova milkbar sold milk-plus, milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom, which is what we were drinking. This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.

### Thank You ###

A long overdue thank you goes out to the most thorough, informative and well developed tutorial on the world wide web: *[Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails](http://railstutorial.org/ "Rails Tutorial")* by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/ "Michael Hartl")

It's hard being a cynic when you find people in the world like Michael Hartl.
